# postfix role.
# Default: root
postfix_role: root

# The internet hostname of this mail system. The default is to use the
# fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) from ``gethostname()``, or to use the
# non-FQDN result from ``gethostname()`` and append ``.$mydomain``.
# ``$myhostname`` is used as a default value for many other configuration
# parameters.
postfix_myhostname: '{{ ansible_fqdn }}'

# The internet domain name of this mail system. The default is to use
# ``$myhostname`` minus the first component, or ``localdomain`` (Postfix 2.3
# and later). ``$mydomain`` is used as a default value for many other
# configuration parameters.
postfix_mydomain: '{{ ansible_domain }}'

# The domain name that locally-posted mail appears to come from, and that
# locally posted mail is delivered to. The default, ``$myhostname``, is
# adequate for small sites. If you run a domain with multiple machines, you
# should (1) change this to ``$mydomain`` and (2) set up a domain-wide alias
# database that aliases each user to ``user@that.users.mailhost``.
postfix_myorigin: '$myhostname'

# The set of characters that can separate a user name from its extension
# (example: ``user+foo``), or a ``.forward`` file name from its extension
# (example: ``.forward+foo``). Basically, the software tries ``user+foo`` and
# ``.forward+foo`` before trying user and ``.forward``. This implementation
# recognizes one delimiter character and one extension per email address or
# ``.forward`` file name.
postfix_recipient_delimiter: ''

# The network interface addresses that this mail system receives mail on.
# Specify ``all`` to receive mail on all network interfaces (default), and
# ``loopback-only`` to receive mail on loopback network interfaces only
# (Postfix version 2.2 and later). The parameter also controls delivery of
# mail to ``user@[ip.address]``.
postfix_inet_interfaces:
  - all

# The list of domains that are delivered via the ``$local_transport`` mail
# delivery transport. By default this is the Postfix local(8) delivery agent
# which looks up all recipients in ``/etc/passwd`` and ``/etc/aliases``. The
# SMTP server validates recipient addresses with ``$local_recipient_maps``
# and rejects non-existent recipients. See also the local domain class in the
# ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.
postfix_mydestination: []

# The list of "trusted" remote SMTP clients that have more privileges than
# "strangers".
postfix_mynetworks: []

# The method to generate the default value for the ``mynetworks`` parameter.
# This is the list of trusted networks for relay access control etc. Specify
# ``mynetworks_style = host`` when Postfix should "trust" only the local
# machine. Specify ``mynetworks_style = subnet`` when Postfix should "trust"
# remote SMTP clients in the same IP subnetworks as the local machine. On
# Linux, this works correctly only with interfaces specified with the
# ``ifconfig`` command. Specify ``mynetworks_style = class`` when Postfix
# should "trust" remote SMTP clients in the same IP class A/B/C networks as
# the local machine. Caution: this may cause Postfix to "trust" your entire
# provider's network. Instead, specify an explicit ``mynetworks`` list by
# hand, as described with the ``mynetworks`` configuration parameter.
postfix_mynetworks_style: host

# The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code when a recipient address is
# local, and ``$local_recipient_maps`` specifies a list of lookup tables that
# does not match the recipient. A recipient address is local when its domain
# matches ``$mydestination``, ``$proxy_interfaces`` or ``$inet_interfaces``.
postfix_unknown_local_recipient_reject_code: 550

# Optional lookup tables that alias specific mail addresses or domains to other
# local or remote address. The table format and lookups are documented in
# virtual(5). For an overview of Postfix address manipulations see the
# ADDRESS_REWRITING_README document.
postfix_virtual_alias_maps: ''

# Postfix is final destination for the specified list of virtual alias domains,
# that is, domains for which all addresses are aliased to addresses in other
# local or remote domains. The SMTP server validates recipient addresses with
# ``$virtual_alias_maps`` and rejects non-existent recipients. See also the
# virtual alias domain class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file
postfix_virtual_alias_domains: ''

# List of TLS protocols that the Postfix SMTP client will exclude or include
# with opportunistic TLS encryption. The default value is ``!SSLv2, !SSLv3``
# for Postfix releases after the middle of 2015, ``!SSLv2`` for older
# releases. Before Postfix 2.6, the Postfix SMTP client would use all
# protocols with opportunistic TLS.
postfix_ssl_protocols:
  - TLSv1
  - TLSv1.1
  - TLSv1.2
  - '!SSLv2'
  - '!SSLv3'

# Define a list of aliases, they will be written to the ``/etc/aliases`` file.
# Default is an empty list.
postfix_aliases: []

# A possible alias list can look like this:
#
# .. code-block:: YAML
#
#   postfix_aliases:
#     - name: root
#       alias: root@example.com
